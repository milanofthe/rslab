//! Direct vertex-separator computation via two-sided Fiduccia-Mattheyses.
//!
//! Clean-room reconstruction of the algorithm in Pellegrini, "SCOTCH:
//! A software package for static mapping..." (HPCN Europe, 1996), §3.
//! No code is paraphrased from SCOTCH's `vgraph_separate_fm.c`
//! (CeCILL-C). The corrected gain formula, the incremental
//! `frontier_load` arrays, the per-move *and* final-prefix imbalance
//! checks, and the lighter-side initial separator construction follow
//! the audit findings in `dev/plans/ordering-scotch.md` (findings 1,
//! 6, 7) and the research note `dev/research/scotch-vertex-separator.md`.
//!
//! ## Difference from feral-metis
//!
//! `feral_metis::internals::separator::construct_separator` derives a
//! node separator *post-hoc* from an edge bisection by computing a
//! minimum vertex cover of the boundary bipartite graph (König's
//! theorem). That route minimises a tight upper bound on the
//! separator size, but the separator weight itself is not the
//! optimisation target.
//!
//! This module instead treats *separator weight* as the primary
//! objective. Starting from the boundary of the lighter side (a
//! trivially-valid but non-minimal separator), two-sided FM moves
//! shrink the separator while keeping the surviving sides balanced.
