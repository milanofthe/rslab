//! KaHIP-style flow-based nested-dissection fill-reducing ordering.
//!
//! **Status: phases K1-K6 complete.**
//! [`kahip_order`] produces a contract-conforming permutation via the
//! full pipeline: K1 data reduction (degree-1 / degree-2 / twin /
//! subset), then K2-K6 multilevel flow-based nested dissection on the
//! reduced graph (coarsen → initial bisect → uncoarsen with K3 flow
//! refinement → K4 boundary-bipartite node separator → recurse), then
//! K1 expansion to lift the reduced-graph permutation back to original
//! indices.
//!
//! **Plan.** `dev/plans/ordering-kahip.md` tracks the six
//! implementation phases:
//!   - K1: Data reduction (degree-1 / degree-2 / twin / neighborhood-
//!     subset rules, fixed-point loop, expansion permutation stack).
//!   - K2: Push-relabel max-flow (with gap relabeling).
//!   - K3: Flow-based edge refinement (band extraction, super-source/
//!     sink construction, Most Balanced Min Cut).
//!   - K4: Flow-based node separator (vertex-capacitated max-flow).
//!   - K5: V-cycle / F-cycle controller (cut-edge-preserving
//!     re-coarsening for monotone quality improvement).
//!   - K6: Driver and Fast / Eco / Strong modes.
//!
//! **Reference papers** (published, public-domain algorithms — the
//! implementation must be clean-room from these sources, not from
//! KaHIP's C++ codebase):
//!   - Sanders & Schulz, "Engineering Multilevel Graph Partitioning
//!     Algorithms" (2011) — the kaffpa framework.
//!   - Ost, Schulz & Strash, "Engineering Data Reduction for Nested
//!     Dissection" (2021) — the K1 reduction rules.
//!
//! The public surface conforms to the RSLAB ordering-crate contract
//! (`dev/plans/ordering-crate-contract.md`): `CscPattern`,
//! `OrderingStats`, `OrderingError`, and `CONTRACT_VERSION` are
//! re-exported from `rslab-ordering-core`.
