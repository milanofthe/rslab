//! Issue #46 — delayed-pivot cascade on a structurally-zero (2,2)-block
//! saddle-point / IPM KKT.
//!
//! ## The bug
//!
//! On a KKT `[[H, Bᵀ], [B, 0]]` whose (2,2) block is structurally
//! absent, FERAL's numeric Bunch-Kaufman kernel re-derived every pivot
//! blind via magnitude-argmax. For a zero-diagonal constraint column
//! `k`, BK picks `r` = the row of the largest off-diagonal coupling;
//! when that `r` is not fully summed (an out-of-front coupling) the
//! kernel could neither form a 2×2 nor 1×1 the zero diagonal, so it
//! *delayed* the column up the elimination tree. The delays cascaded —
//! on the POUNCE `cho` KKT this produced a 23× factor-nonzero blowup
//! and a ~160× end-to-end slowdown vs MA57. See
//! `dev/research/kkt-zero-2x2-block-cascade-2026-05-20.md`.
//!
//! ## The fix
//!
//! `scalar_pivot_step` now selects the 2×2 partner explicitly. The
//! MC64-matched saddle partner is co-located at the adjacent
//! fully-summed column `k+1`, so when the BK argmax row `r` is not
//! fully summed the kernel falls back to `k+1` as the 2×2 partner
//! instead of delaying.
//!
//! ## Oracle
//!
//! The matrix is a genuine saddle-point KKT with `H` SPD and `B` full
//! row rank. By the saddle-point inertia theorem (external math —
//! Benzi, Golub & Liesen, *Numerical solution of saddle point
//! problems*, Acta Numerica 2005, §3.4) its inertia is exactly
//! `(nv, nc, 0)`. The solve residual is an identity check. The fill
//! bound is a measurement oracle: a healthy factorization stays
//! within a small multiple of the symbolic no-delay estimate, whereas
//! the #46 cascade blew it up 20×+.

/// Build the lower triangle of a saddle-point KKT in *constraints-first*

///
/// — a symmetric permutation of the textbook `[[H, Bᵀ], [B, 0]]`, so
/// inertia is unchanged. Constraints occupy indices `[0, nc)` and
/// variables `[nc, n)`. The constraints-first layout matters: MC64
/// pairs each constraint `c` with a variable of *higher* index, and
/// `build_supermap` canonicalises pairs as `(min, max)`, so the
/// co-located pair is expanded constraint-then-variable — the numeric
/// kernel reaches the zero-diagonal constraint column *first*, exactly
/// as it does on a real IPM KKT.
///
/// Structure:
///   - variable `0` (matrix index `nc`) is the "global" variable `g`,
///     coupled to *every* constraint — highest degree, eliminated last
///     at the root front;
///   - variable `1 + c` (matrix index `nc + 1 + c`) is constraint
///     `c`'s "local" variable, coupled only to constraint `c`;
///   - each constraint `c` couples to `g` with the *larger* magnitude
///     `2.0` and to its local variable with `1.0`. MC64 can co-locate
///     `g` with only one constraint; every other constraint's largest
///     coupling (`g`) is therefore an out-of-front trailing row when
///     its child panel is factored. BK's magnitude-argmax lands on
///     that out-of-front `g` — the exact #46 trigger;
///   - `H` is diagonal `4.0` (SPD) and the structurally-explicit `0.0`
///     is the (2,2) diagonal a POUNCE live KKT constraint carries.
///
/// `B` has full row rank (the local-variable columns form an `nc × nc`
/// identity block) and `H` is SPD, so `A` is non-singular with inertia
/// exactly `(nv, nc, 0)`.
