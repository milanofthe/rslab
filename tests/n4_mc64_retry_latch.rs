//! N4 (`dev/research/repo-review-2026-06-09.md`): the issue-#65 MC64
//! scaling retry has no "tried and not adopted" latch. On *adoption* the
//! sticky-Auto pick pins `Mc64Symmetric`, so the retry gate's
//! `!matches!(..Mc64Symmetric)` clause suppresses the retry on every
//! subsequent same-pattern `factor()`. But on *non-adoption* — the case the
//! issue-#65 comment explicitly anticipates, "a GENUINELY singular matrix
//! [where] the retry also force-accepts zeros, the strict-improvement gate
//! fails, and the original factor is kept (cost: one wasted
//! factorization)" — nothing was recorded. The retry gate keys on
//! `self.numeric_params.scaling == Auto` (the user config, which never
//! changes) and on the resolved scaling staying non-MC64 (it does, since
//! the picker re-pins InfNorm), so every subsequent `factor()` on the same
//! pattern re-pays a full Hungarian + a complete second factorization. The
//! comment's "one wasted factorization" is actually one *per call*,
//! indefinitely.
//!
//! Reproduction (no fixture needed, unlike `issue65_mc64_fallback.rs`): a
//! tiny, well-scaled, genuinely rank-deficient symmetric matrix.
//!
//!   A = [[1, 1, 0],
//!        [1, 1, 0],
//!        [0, 0, 1]]   (stored as the lower triangle)
//!
//! Rows 0 and 1 are identical ⇒ rank 2, inertia (2, 0, 1). It is small, so
//! `pick_scaling_strategy` routes `Auto` to `InfNorm` (no arrow head); the
//! BK factorization force-accepts the one zero pivot and reports
//! `zero == 1`. That fires the issue-#65 retry, but MC64 cannot change rank
//! — the retry also reports `zero == 1`, the strict-improvement gate fails,
//! and the original factor is kept (non-adoption).
//!
//! `mc64_retry_attempt_count()` counts every retry that *ran*:
//!   * Pre-fix (no latch): call 1 runs the retry (count 1); call 2 on the
//!     SAME pattern re-runs it (count 2) — RED.
//!   * Post-fix (per-pattern latch): call 1 runs the retry (count 1); call 2
//!     is suppressed by the latch (count stays 1) — GREEN.
