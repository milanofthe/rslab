//! Generic multifrontal sparse LDLᵀ factorization over any [`Scalar`] field.
//!
//! This drives a full sparse symmetric-indefinite solve for both the real
//! (`f64`) and complex-*symmetric* (`Complex<f64>`, PARDISO `mtype 6`) paths by
//! reusing the existing **value-agnostic** symbolic analysis (ordering,
//! elimination tree, supernode amalgamation) and applying the generic dense
//! Bunch-Kaufman kernel from [`crate::dense::ldlt_generic`] front-by-front.
//!
//! This is the single, data-type-generic symmetric multifrontal driver (the
//! former f64-dedicated driver has been removed). It is rayon-parallel with a
//! `gemm` BLAS-3 Schur update and relaxed amalgamation; delayed pivoting and
//! the remaining rslab robustness features are being ported in.
//!
//! ## Current pivoting scope
//!
//! * Pivoting is restricted to the **fully-summed block** of each front (no
//!   delayed pivoting). This produces a valid factorization whenever each
//!   fully-summed block is nonsingular; pathological indefinite cases that
//!   would require delaying a pivot to the parent are out of scope for now and
//!   surface as [`RslabError::NumericallyRankDeficient`].
//! * The reassembled factor is held as a dense `n×n` global `L`. This is
//!   `O(n²)` memory and is a correctness-first choice; a sparse-CSC global `L`
//!   with a supernodal triangular solve is a later optimization.
//!
//! The result is returned as an [`LdltFactors`] in factorization order, so the
//! generic [`solve_ldlt`](crate::dense::ldlt_generic::solve_ldlt) handles the
//! triangular/diagonal solves and permutation directly.
